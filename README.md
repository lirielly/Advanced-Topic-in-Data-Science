A classification system to detect questionable information

General description:
You are given a dataset comprised of 18k tweets about the last U.S. Presidential election, which were retrieved before the election was held. The tweets are already labeled as TRUE or FALSE in the field questionable_domain. The ultimate goal of this project is for you to create a classification system for tweets in order to identify where a new (unseen) tweet is disseminating questionable information, or not. Therefore, in this project you should:
• Perform an exploratory data analysis on the dataset
• Identify relevant features to use in your machine learning model. Note that many features will need to be computed from the available information in the dataset
• Use four machine learning algorithms to train the classifier
• Perform an evaluation of the model/classifiers
• Report your process in an article-type document
• Do a presentation of your work

Deliverables:
1. The classification System
a. The first thing to bear in mind is that you are using real data. Therefore, the data may not be “clean”. Secondly, although you have in the dataset several features to use in your model (e.g., number of friends, followers, favorites, retweets, etc.), the most interesting features to be included in the model would derive from the description and the title fields of the tweet.
b. You are expected to create a model with more than a dozen features. Also, for each feature, there must be a particular motivation for including it in the model (which you should briefly describe in your report).
c. You should also experiment your model with four machine learning algorithms.
d. Evaluate the selected algorithms according to well-known metrics.
Be advised: it is important that your group can add something (e.g., a different model, different features) that differentiates itself from any other group in the class. You will score for that creativity.

2. Report as an article
a. The project report should be written in the standard IEEE conference format template (max. 4 pages).
b. The report should include the title, authors, an abstract and a conclusion. The inclusion in the report of at least 4 figures is mandatory in order to better explain your model or the assessment.
c. Clearly explain the transformations you did to the dataset in order to obtain your final model, discuss the features you use to tackle the problem and your novelties.
d. Report on the evaluation of your model.

3. Final presentation
a. Prepare a 15-minute (maximum) presentation to explain what you did and the results you achieved using an electronic presentation as a support, mainly for graphics, illustrations, and tables. Note that every group member must participate in the presentation.
b. Note: You also get points based on the quality of the electronic presentation.
c. You can schedule your presentation for one of the three available slots on an activity in MoodleUP. Please, choose a single group participant to register your choice as the number of time slots is limited
